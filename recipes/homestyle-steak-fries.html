        <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
            <p>Perfectly crispy, oven-baked steak fries that can be made at home using only three or four simple ingredients. Great as a side dish for roasts, eggs, and other meats.</p>
            <p>Adjust ingredient quantities according to the number of people being served.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4-6 large white potatoes</li>
                <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Optional Ingredients</h3>
            <p>Mix and match the following toppings and spices for a wide variety of flavours.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Any kind of melting cheese including mozzarella, cheddar, havarti, or Gouda.</li>
                <li>Onions or leeks.</li>
                <li>Spices, eg., smoked paprika. </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Depending on preference, you may either peel the potatoes or leave the skin on. If you opt for unpeel potatoes, be sure to scrub the skin thoroughly and cut out any bad spots.</li>
                <li>Cut potatoes into wedges, approximately 1-1.5 inches in diameter and 3/4 inch thick.</li>
                <li>Rinse potato wedges under cold water. Place in a large stock pot. Fill with cold water until potatoes are submerged. Add salt to water.</li>
                <li>Bring water to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium.</li>
                <li>Check periodically by inserting a knife into potatoe wedges. Once the potatoes have softened just enough for the knife to poke through, remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
                <li>Pour over a colander OR use a slotted spoon to remove potatoes from pot.</li>
                <li>Transfer potatoes to a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Add olive oil, salt, and pepper, and toss until evenly mixed.</li>
                <li>Place sheet pan on the bottom rack of oven and cook until the undersides of the potatoes are crispy brown. This may take anywhere from 10-15 minutes, depending on oven type and model.</li>
                <li>Move the sheet pan to the middle rack and set oven to broil until the top of the potatoes have crisped and become golden-brown.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven and serve. Add shredded cheese or chopped onions for additional flavour.</li>
            </ol>
